# Netlib LP Data to MPS
This repository contains Netlib LP problem data that has been converted into the readily usable MPS format.

## Disclaimer
The data here are the compressed MPS files and the data that need to be generated by generators from https://www.netlib.org/lp/data/, expanded into a readily usable MPS format. Please visit the original site first and check its contents carefully.

## Contents
The repository includes the following:

1. Converted MPS Files: These are files that have been converted from the original LP format into MPS format for easier use.

2. Unconverted Problem Names: Some problems from the Netlib LP dataset could not be converted. The names of these problems are listed here. If you can successfully convert these, please let us know.

## Unconverted Problems
The following problem sets could not be converted to MPS:

- QAP8
- QAP12
- QAP15
- STOCFOR3
For QAP8, QAP12, and QAP15, generators will need to be acquired from https://www.netlib.org/lp/generators/qap/.

For STOCFOR3, attempts to convert it resulted in the following error:

```bash
% ./std2mps
Process TIME file:
   1    TIME          STOCHFOR
  10    ENDATA
Process CORE file:
   1                                  0.0000                   0.0000
XXX -  FATAL  - Illegal record in CORE file
STD2MPS: execution terminated.
```

Any assistance in converting these would be greatly appreciated.
